# Python Endless Runner Game With Pygame Library

## A simple endless running game inspired by Google's dinosaur game.

This project was built as an attempt to replicate Google's dinosaur game. The overall functionality is identical, however obstacle generation is simplified. The game includes
the following:

* A starting homescreen page.
* Random obstacle generation.
* A character that is able to jump in order to avoid obstacles.
* Gradual increase in difficulty.
* Score tracking.

## Game Instructions

The game is very simple to play, and has identical controls to Google's dinosaur game. 

* The space key or up arrow key are used to make the character jump.
* The down arrow key can be used to make the character descend more quickly.

Note: Unlike Google's dinosaur game, there is no ducking feature as no such obstacles are generated that require this action.

## Installation Instructions

The installation process is very simple:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure that pygame is installed. If it is not, it can be installed with pip via the command: 'pip install pygame'.
3. Run the main.py file and enjoy :D

## Known Issues

* Obstacle sprites frequently flicker on the screen. This is still a work in progress, and will hopefully be resolved ASAP.
